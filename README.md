Hi, I'm Yuseon Choi. I recently completed my M.S. degree at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. During my time at GIST, I conducted research at the Speech and Audio Processing Lab (SAPL), focusing on deep learning-based sound source localization and speech enhancement technologies for applications such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spatial audio capturing services. If you'd like to know more about me, feel free to check out my CV and blog.
