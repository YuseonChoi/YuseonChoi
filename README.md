Hi, I'm Yuseon Choi. I recently completed my M.S. degree at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. During my time at GIST, I conducted research at the Speech and Audio Processing Lab (SAPL), focusing on deep learning-based sound source localization and speech enhancement technologies for applications such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spatial audio capturing services.
